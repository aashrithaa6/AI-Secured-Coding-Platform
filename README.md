# AI-Secured-Coding-Platform
A secure AI-powered coding test platform that ensures fair online assessments by preventing cheating. It uses browser activity monitoring, dynamic visual obfuscation, and AI-based proctoring to detect tab switches, screenshots, and camera captures, maintaining test integrity and trust.
# AI-Secured Coding Assessment Platform

## Overview
A secure web-based platform for conducting coding assessments without cheating.  
It uses browser monitoring, AI-based proctoring, and dynamic visual distortion to prevent screenshots, tab switching, or camera captures.

## Problem Statement
Online exams and coding tests are vulnerable to cheating through screenshots, external AI tools, and camera captures.  
This project ensures fair and authentic assessments by using AI and cybersecurity techniques.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Monaco Editor  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB / Firebase Firestore  
- **Auth:** Firebase Auth / JWT  
- **AI Layer:** TensorFlow.js (for proctoring), WebGL (for visual obfuscation)  
- **Deployment:** Vercel / Render / AWS

## Features
- Anti-screenshot & anti-tab switch detection  
- Camera-based cheating prevention  
- AI-powered proctoring (face & device detection)  
- Secure code execution sandbox  
- Dynamic watermarking to prevent content sharing  

## Architecture
Frontend → API Layer → Backend Server → Database  
Optional AI Module handles face detection & screen monitoring.

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-secured-coding-platform.git
